class ClickButton:
    """Representation of a button with multi-click and hold-detection.

    This was inspired by http://www.mathertel.de/Arduino/OneButtonLibrary.aspx,
    but extended to n-clicks and click-hold.

    .. note::

        Most debouncing code out there is wrong. The debounce functionality of
        RPi.GPIO just suppresses events, but does not debounce. Debouncing
        correctly in software is tricky but doable.
        Read this http://www.ganssle.com/debouncing.htm.

    This button can be bound to GPIO pins but it can be used with other
    input sources as well.

    **What is click, hold, up/down, pressed/released?**

    The state of the button is updated by calling :meth:`update` with ``True`` or ``False`` as
    argument (equivalently just calling the button, calling :meth:`press`, :meth:`release`).
    Updating the state to ``True`` is called `press`, updating the state to ``False`` is called `release`.

    The state is `changed` when :meth:`update` was called with a parameter different from
    the previous call. If the state did not change for a time > ``click_time``, the
    button in considered `down` (stated changed to `pressed`) or `up` (state changed to `released`).
    This effectivly debounces the input. The final state wins, but quick jumps between states
    are filtered out.

    The button is considered `clicked` when

    1. it was `pressed` for > ``click_time`` (click is counted)
    2. and then `released` for > ``double_click_time`` (click is fired)

    If it was pressed again after beeing released within < ``double_click_time``,
    another click may be counted (start again at 1.). This way n-clicks can be detected.

    The button is considered `held` when it was `pressed` for > ``hold_time``
    (enter hold state). There might have been preceding clicks, that have been
    counted, but not fired. This way we get n-hold, with n beeing the number of
    clicks preceding the hold. Hold events are fired as long as the button stays
    held with ``hold_repeat`` delay, if ``hold_repeat`` > 0.

    .. attention::

        Setting ``when_clicked`` or ``when_held`` disables any handlers
        registered with :meth:`on_click` or :meth:`on_hold`. So there is
        either a single click/hold handler or a handler for each type of
        click/hold.

    Args:
        pin (int): BCM_ pin to bind to, 0 = do not use GPIO
        when_clicked (callable(n)): click handler, n = # of clicks
        when_held (callable(n)): hold handler, n = # of clicks before hold
        click_time (float): seconds button needs to stay in pressed/released
            state to consider it a click (this does the debouncing)
        double_click_time (float): max. seconds between clicks to count them
            as double clicks (or triple, or quadruple, ...)
        hold_time (float): seconds in pressed state after which button is
            considered held

            button stays held, 0 = disable hole repeat
